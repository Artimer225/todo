`Todo` is a small learning project that's heavily (let's be straight, I just copied the look) inspired by `todoist.app`. \
I was curious whether I could replicate that app in terms of logic. The design part didn't interest me much. \
As for webpack, there are only two commands:\
 `build: webpack`\
 `dev: webpack serve`
